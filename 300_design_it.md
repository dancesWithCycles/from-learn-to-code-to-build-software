## Design it!

### Derive a structure from iteration scope

Let's recap what we planned to do in the first iteration.

1. `Persistent storage of jobs.`
2. `As Emma, I want to view a list of all available job offerings.`
3. `As Tom, I want to create a job offer, so that job searchers can apply for it.`

Since there is nothing yet available, we can start on the green field. In general, it looks very simple. That is actually what we wanted to achieve with all the discussion beforehand. If it feels simple and clear, we did a good job.
So we need to build a small component for jobs. The component is responsible for persistent storage and provide an interface to retrieve all jobs available and to add new jobs. Since many people shall be able to access this from many devices, this part must reside on the server.
Additionally, we need to build a frontend that allows users like _Emma_ to view the list of available jobs and _Tom_ to create a new job offering.

TODO: Explain a bit the component diagram.

The breakdown of the system can be done as shown in the picture below.

![imag](out/310_design_it_components/Design%20it!%20First%20iteration.png)

We create a job manager that exposes an interface and hides away all the details about persistent managing of jobs in the database.
We also split components that deal with the presentation of data. The `Create Job` component is responsible to take user input and forward that request to the `Job Manager`. Both components talks to the `job_interface` only. There is no need for both components to know in what form the jobs are stored and which technology is used. They only know the interface.
The breakdown makes also sense, since we already know from the backlog user stories about job searching. We can easiy add another component to the `Job Viewer` package and extend the interface. Same is true for the `Job Creator` package. It will be easy to add a component that is responsible to take user input for deletion of a specific job.

### Job Manager Interface

Let's deep dive a bit into the job manager interface. There a multiple ways to implement such an interface, but to keep it simple, it will be designed in form of a REST API.

TODO: Just a view words about REST

Since we currently implement a simple service, only one endpoint is required:

`/jobs`
- `GET /jobs`: return a list of jobs.
- `POST /jobs`: Create a new job

Looks quite easy - and it should be exactly like that! We need to define the details of the a job. At this stage, we do not need to think about it, we just refer the defined acceptance criteria of the corresponding task `Persistent storage of jobs.`.

`1. For each job the following information shall be stored: title, a description, a location, the name of the user who created the offering, a date when it was created.`

We can reformulate the acceptance criteria in a JSON structure.
Here is an example:

```
{
    "title": "Dog walking Sunday morning",
    "description": "I am looking for someone who can walk my dog on Sunday for around 2 hours.",
    "location": "Springfield",
    "user": "Tom",
    "createdAt": "2021-04-11T09:30:43.511Z"
}
```

When `POST`'ing a job, all those information has to be provided in the request. When retrieving a list of jobs, a list of such structures is returned.

### Job Manager internals

We basically know already everything about the internals of the `Job Manager`. Derived from the interface, we can define the inital database structure. We decided to start with a simple SQLite database, so a definition of the table `Jobs` looks like this:

```
CREATE TABLE jobs
(
    Title VARCHAR (100)
    Description VARCHAR (1000)
    Location VARCHAR (100)
    User VARCHAR (50)
    CreatedAt DATETIME
)
```

In later iteratoins, we will most likely replace the type of a user with a reference to an entry in the user table and might take a more sophisticated approach for the location, but for now, having a simple table is more then sufficient.

It's a good hint for the internal design anyway to know that we will have a lot of changes around the data handling. So better to not mix the interface implementation with the database interaction code. On the other hand, we keep it as simple as possible.

TODO: Explain class diagrams a bit

![JobManager Internals](out/310_design_it_components/Job%20Manager%20class%20diagram.png)

There are just two parts as of now. The `JobInterface` and the `JobDataStorage`. The `JobInterface` takes requests coming from the interface and forwards them to the `JobDataStorage`. The `JobDataStorage` will then itself interact with the database to pull or store data.
The `JobInterface` class will not do that much as of now besides converting data. Later, additional functionality can be assigned like checking parameters. But let's not focus on it right now - we are in the first iteration and the main goal is to create simple end-2-end functionality.
Both parts hide external data formats from each other and talk to each other utilizing the defined data type `Job`. Having this structure, the communication between both parts is self-contained and does not depend on the external interfaces. In this case, it does not matter if we replace the REST interface by gRPC or the SQLite database by a noSql database.
Furthermore, testing each part of the `JobManager` can be done individually.

TODO: Explain Sequence diagrams a bit

Finally, let's have a look at how the the defined internal structure supports the two user stories of this iteration.

#### Get all jobs

The following sequence diagram shows how the components communicate with each other.
When `GET /jobs` is invoked, the `JobInterface` will receive the request and forward it to `JobDataStorage`. `JobDataStorage` pulls the data from the database and returns a list of jobs. `JobInterface` converts the received data to JSON and returns the data.

![Get all jobs](out/310_design_it_components/Job%20Manager%20Sequence%20diagram%20-%20Get%20jobs.png)

#### Add a job

When a `POST /jobs` request is received by the `JobInterface`. The `JobInterface` checks the received data and converts it to a `Job`. The job itself is forwarded to the `JobDataStorage` for storage into the database. If everything works, the new job is stored in the database.

### User Interface

Of course `Emma` and `Tom` will not access the `JobManager` directly but through a user interface. In the beginning, we defined the two components `Job Viewer` and `Job Creator` that are repoonsible for presenting the list of available jobs and providing a possiblity to add a new job to the database.
There are many possiblities of a user interface. It could be a mobile application, a webpage, a desktop or a command line application. Since we have split the application directly in the beginning roughly in front- (`Job Viewer` and `Job Creator`) and backend (`JobManager`), it will be straight forward to add additional visual representations later. For the first iteration, a webpage seems to be easiest.
The structure of the website can be kept simple as well:

Path | Description
 --- | ---
 /   | Welcome page
 /jobs | List all available jobs
 /jobs/create | Create a new job

We do not care about how the website looks in the first iteration. Design (at if you are not a doing it very often) is a very time consuming task. To make it right a lot of user interaction testing will be required. Therefore, we will keep it simple and just make it functional.

### Put it all together

Below is the summary of the complete interaction from a User to the database and back. The goal is not to describe every detail. Otherwise we would replicate the code. It just shall support the development so that we do not get lost in details in code and have a frame to fill.
